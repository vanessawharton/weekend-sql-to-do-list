# Project Name

To Do List using SQL


## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

The goal of this project was to create a full-stack CRUD app that allowed a user to keep a dynamic to-do list. Any changes the user submits through the client are stored and sent through a server to be stored on a local database. Any changes to the database, including tasks being added, completed, and deleted result in a full refresh of the information stored on the database. 

There are simple buttons to toggle tasks to mark as completed/incomplete, priority/non-priority, and to delete a task. Priority items are listed before non-priority tasks.
