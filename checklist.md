<!-- 
## Stretch Goals
- `feature-styling-bootstrap` 
[ ]  Add Bootstrap to the front end and style it up!
-  Buttons -- make the creation buttons and completion buttons green and the delete red.
-  Inputs -- make your text inputs styled in the bootstrap way
-  Responsive -- make your app responsive to different screen sizes -- check out the [Layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/) section

`feature-confirm-delete`

    - [ ]  In whatever fashion you would like, create an 'are you sure: yes / no' option when deleting a task.
        - Some styled options are [Bootstrap Modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/) or [Sweet Alerts](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/): Use the CDN option.

- `feature-ordering-task-query` 
- [ ]  Research [Query Params](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query) to have the request reverse the order of the returned to-dos. 

- `feature-time-completed` 
- [ ]  Add the ability to record when a task was completed. Show the completed date on the frontend in a pretty format. -->
